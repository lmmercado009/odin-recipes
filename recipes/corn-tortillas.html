        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            If you ever feel like your taco filling is the best it can be, but your tacos
            are still missing <em>something</em>, this recipe for homemade corn tortillas might
            be <strong>exactly</strong> what you need!
        </p>

        <p>
            Store-bought corn tortillas do just fine for quick and easy tacos, but if you
            have some extra time, making them yourself is a worthwhile investment. This
            recipe requires only a few ingredients and can be easily scaled up. <em><strong>Enjoy!</strong></em>
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Masa Harina, 2 cups</li>
            <li>Broth (chicken or vegetable), 1 1/2 cups</li>
            <li>Kosher Salt, 1 tsp</li>
            <li>Non-stick spray</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a medium to large bowl, combine masa harina and kosher salt with your
                chosen broth, mixing thoroughly with your hands or a fork
            </li>
            <li>
                Once thoroughly mixed, let sit for 2 minutes then check for hydration --
                dough should hold its shape and be firm to the touch, but not show any
                signs of cracking
            </li>
            <li>
                If dough is <em>too loose</em>, slowly mix in additional masa harina, or if
                dough is <em>too dry</em> (starting to crack), slowly add in additional water
            </li>
            <li>
                Once dough reaches desired hydration, cover with plastic wrap or a clean towel
                and let sit for <strong>at least</strong> 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>After rest is complete, begin pinching small portions of dough and rolling
                between <strong>clean hands</strong> to form balls of about 1" in diameter, placing
                on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper
            </li>
            <li>
                Once all dough has been formed into balls, use a tortilla press lined with parchment
                paper or a cut-open freezer bag to flatten each one to desired thickness, setting
                aside onto parchment paper
            </li>
            <li>
                Pre-heat a dry cast iron skillet (or griddle, or comal) over medium heat
            </li>
            <li>
                Once skillet is pre-heated, lightly apply non-stick spray then add a tortilla and cook
                for 45-60 seconds on each side before transferring to a clean plate (under a clean towel)
                or a tortilla holder (lined inside with clean towel)
            </li>
            <li>
                Repeat for remainind dough balls, turn off heat, and <em>serve tortillas while fresh</em>!
            </li>
        </ol>

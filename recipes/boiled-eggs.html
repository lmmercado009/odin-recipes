        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            If you have ever struggled getting your boiled eggs to be <em><strong>exactly</strong></em>
            the way you want them, give this recipe a try!
        </p>

        <p>This recipe aims to prioritize eggs that are easy to peel and
            <em><strong>not</strong></em> overcooked.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Eggs, 12 large, uncooked</li>
            <li>Water, tap</li>
            <li>Ice Cubes, 12</li>
            <li>Kosher Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Pepper, freshly cracked, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Remove eggs from fridge to begin tempering slightly
            </li>
            <li>
                Add 4 quarts (2 quarts per 6 eggs) of water to a large pot, cover, and
                bring to a rolling boil
            </li>
            <li>
                Once water is boiling, <em><strong>carefully</strong></em> add eggs to
                the pot a few at a time (however many you can safely add without splashing)
            </li>
            <li>
                Watch for water to return to rolling boil, then let continue for 30 seconds
            </li>
            <li>
                Add ice cubes to pot, then watch for water to return to a simmer
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce heat to low and maintain water at a sub-simmer according to the
                below time-table:
                <ul>
                    <li>Soft-Boiled: 5-6 minutes</li>
                    <li>Medium-Boiled: 7-8 minutes</li>
                    <li>Hard-Boiled: 9-10 minutes</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Once desired time is reached, turn off heat and <em><strong>carefully</strong></em>
                transfer all eggs from pot to a clean bowl and move to the sink
            </li>
            <li>
                Under cold, running water peel each egg, rinse, and transfer to a seprate clean bowl
            </li>
            <li>
                Once all eggs are peeled, set aside any you plan to save for later in an airtight container
            </li>
            <li>
                Slice remaining eggs in half (from pole to pole, <strong>not</strong> along equator) and
                season to taste with kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, then <em><strong>enjoy!</strong></em>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            This house spagetti recipe aims to keep things <em>simple</em>
            ,but <strong>delicious</strong>. While making your own marinara sauce
            from scratch may seem daunting at first, it can be accomplished fairly quickly
            and with only a few quality, <em>fresh</em> ingredients.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you feel comfortable making this recipe, I encourage you to make it
            your own by making modifications and adding personal touches to suit your tastes.
            <em><strong>Enjoy!</strong></em>
